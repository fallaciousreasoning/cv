## A Personal Statement
I'm sophisticated, witty, charming, good looking and intelligent. At least, that's what my Mum tells me. More seriously, I have a BE(hons) in Software Engineering and I've been working full time in the industry since 2017 and interning at various companies since 2014. My background is in C#, C++ and Typescript/JavaScript.

## Previous Work

Most recently, I’ve been at Google, working on Chromium, with a particular focus on offline web apps on desktop. My contributions included design and implementation work on the [Badging API](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6068482055602176), implementing the custom tab bar for desktop PWAs, and designing and implementing a prototype of a new [File Handling API](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5721776357113856) for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). This work was largely C++ based, though I also did standardization work for these APIs.

Before Google, I was employed at Envoy Advanced Technologies where I worked on a number of projects, including a piece of enterprise software for managing building certifications ([BCS](https://www.certification.systems/)), using ASP.NET and Knockout; a cross platform mobile app for building inspectors, using Xamarin Forms; an iOS app written in Swift to showcase a new streaming algorithm; and a new [corporate travel product](https://www.alienta.net), written in dotnet core 2.0, React and TypeScript.

Over the 2016/2017 summer, I interned in the Mozilla media team, which involved work with encrypted video playback and content decryption modules. This was almost entirely in C++ (with a little side of JavaScript, for tests). In particular I added sub sample encryption support to EME playback of MP4 ([Bug 1318792](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1318792)) and WebM videos ([Bug 1306477](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1306477)), which included some major refactors and minor bugfixes.

For the 2015/2016 break I interned at Jade, as a part of a Callaghan grant, doing researchy stuff. This work was mostly in C# (for the backend) with a side of JavaScript for an Angular.js frontend. I worked on a few different aspects of a project called ‘[OnSide](https://onside.co.nz/company/blog/onside-and-jade-software-bring-innovation-to-health-and-safety/);’ an app for helping farmers keep track of risks and contractors on farms.
